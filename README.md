# BC Hacks 5.0

This was the first serious attempt at a hackathon for all of us. We battled Visual Studio for hours, spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas, and learned quite a bit in the span of just ~36 hours. I set up my first cloud development database, used my first ORM, wrote my first C# code, learned to use tailwind, learned about the existence of .NET MAUI and Blazor, and most importantly, learned that sleep is most definitely NOT optional
